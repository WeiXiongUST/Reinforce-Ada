## 📢 Introduction
This repository contains the official implementation for Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework designed to resolve the ``signal collapse'' problem in Reinforce-style algorithm with group baseline such as GRPO, making training more efficient and effective.

### 🧐 The Challenge: Signal Collapse in GRPO
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a widely-used algorithm in Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR). It calculates the advantage by normalizing rewards within a group of n responses:
$$g_\theta(x,a) =  \frac{r_i - \bar{r}}{\sigma_r + \varepsilon} \cdot \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|x).$$

While effective, GRPO suffers from a critical flaw in practice: **signal collapse**. When all n samples for a prompt yield the same reward (e.g., all correct or all incorrect), **the gradient is zero** for all the responses and there is no learning signal for this prompt.

</p>
<i><b>Figure 2:</b> The proportion of prompts with zero gradient (uniform rewards) remains high during training.</i>

This isn't a minor issue. It frequently occurs early in training (when models fail on hard prompts) and later in training (when models master easy ones). Crucially, this is a **statistical artifact of undersampling**, not a sign that the prompts are useless. A larger sample size n would often reveal a mix of correct and incorrect answers, unlocking a valid learning signal. For instance, the RL trained model exhibits 35.3\% all-correct groups at n=4, but only 10.2\% at n=256. These results demonstrate that the missing signal is often recoverable with larger n, confirming that uniform-reward collapse is a sampling artifact rather than a model limitation.

</p>

However, uniformly increasing n for all prompts is computationally prohibitive. Seminal works like DeepSeek-R1 show that a small group size (e.g., n=16) is sufficient for an effective gradient update. This reveals a gap between the large inference budget needed to find a signal and the smaller update budget needed to learn from it.


### ✨ Our Solution Reinforce-Ada: Reinforce with Adaptive Sampling
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework that intelligently allocates the inference budget. Instead of a fixed n, our algorithm samples in rounds, deactivating prompts once a sufficient learning signal is found. This frees up computation, allowing difficult prompts to be sampled more deeply until a useful signal emerges.

<i><b>Algorithm 1:</b> The Reinforce-Ada framework.</i>
</p>

Our framework consists of three core ideas:

1. **Adaptive Sampling**: A successive elimination process that eliminates prompts with sufficient learning signals and keeps sampling the unsolved prompts.
2. **Principled Exit Conditions**: Flexible rules (Reinforce-Ada-pos, Reinforce-Ada-balance) to determine when a prompt is resolved, balancing signal diversity and sampling efficiency.
3. **Robust Advantage Calculation**: We compute the advantage baseline $(r_i-\bar{r})$ using statistics from the entire pool of responses generated for a prompt, not just the final down-sampled batch, leading to more stable estimates.

### Key Results
Our experiments show that Reinforce-Ada consistently improves sample efficiency and final model performance across various models and benchmarks.
